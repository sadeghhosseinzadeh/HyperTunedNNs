**Deep Learning Model Comparison**
This repository contains code comparing four deep learning models: MLP, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. We used these models to predict the average price of EUR/USD on a 4-hour chart.

**Important Note**
The goal here is not to make accurate predictions, as this task requires extensive economic insights and much more data. Therefore, please do not use this code for trading in forex or other stocks.

**Purpose**
The primary purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to tune deep learning models using Keras Tuner. I have included many variables to be tuned, which may not be necessary in every case. However, they are included here to illustrate the process of tuning various parameters.

**Note**
Due to some changes in Keras Tuner, my MLP model had some problems. I will upload it as soon as I have the time to fix it.
